# Hyprland Config

## About the repository
This repository contains the configurations from my arch linux environment, which uses *Hyprland* as the main windows manager.

This repository, althought idealy should have all the respective config/settings files, due to the nature of the associated contents may not include every file, the reason will be added if that is the case, althought it might be just because I forgot to add it.

I might finish this section including that, althought the main idea was for me to setting up everything in my system, I still made use of external resources (exaple: the waybar), in that cases I will add the respective credits to the original authors.

## What will you find
1) Hyprland configurations.
2) ZHS shell.
