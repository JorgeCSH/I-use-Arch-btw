# Hyprland Config

## About the repository
This repository contains the configurations from my Arch Linux environment, which uses *Hyprland* as the main window manager.

While this repository ideally should include all relevant configuration and settings files, it may not contain every file due to the nature of the associated contents. If any files are missing, I will provide the reason, which may simply be that I forgot to include them.

Although the main idea was for me to set up everything on my system, I have also used external resources (e.g., Waybar), and in such cases, I will add the respective credits to the original authors.

## What will you find[^1]
1) Hyprland.
2) ZHS shell.

## 1) Hyprland 
The *Hyprland* ``config_files`` directory that I included contain scripts I created for various purposes. The ```config_files``` directory includes the main script (automatically generated by *Hyprland*) and *Hyprpaper*. The ```hyprland.config``` file sets up basic configurations, such as display settings, shell preferences, and key bindings, while ```hyprpaper.config``` enables the *Hyprpaper* extension, allowing you to add custom wallpapers.
