# Hyprland Config

## About the repository
This repository contains the configurations from my Arch Linux environment, which uses *Hyprland* as the main window manager.

While this repository ideally should include all relevant configuration and settings files, it may not contain every file due to the nature of the associated contents. If any files are missing, I will provide the reason, which may simply be that I forgot to include them.

Although the main idea was for me to set up everything on my system, I have also used external resources (e.g., Waybar), and in such cases, I will add the respective credits to the original authors.

## What will you find[^1]
1) Hyprland.
2) ZHS shell.

## 1) Hyprland 
The *Hyprland* config_files that I included have scripts I made for different reasons. Currently the ```config_files``` directory has the main script (automatically made by *Hyprland*) and *Hyprpaper*. ```hyprland.config``` has the script to make the basic configuration such as displays, shell preferences, key binds among others, while ```hyprpaper.config``` allows you to use the *Hyprpaper* extension[^2], so you can add your own custom wallpaper.
